I want to work propose a new feature but need to create a design document first. The format of this output will be a well formed feature proposal for a github issue on the upstream repository.

When fetching content (i.e. email), it is often hard to filter out the relevant items as well as the ones that need action, one of the main goals for PKM systems. It is
also important to keep track of all of the important things and achievements that have been done (a hidden motive might be to use this output for performance and development
reviews. While this is a valid use case, we do NOT want to mention it in the feature itself, just to be used in its refinement).

While it is possible to integrate with foundational models to do this analysis, my hypothesis is that we would likely be able to leverage local hardware reasonable well, especially since
we might only run syncs once a day.

Do not just accept the following idea. Consider it with its consistency with the rest of the project. If it seems to be better to be kept separate, then we can have a discussion about that.
If it only makes sense to integrate part of this into this tool, we can have a discussion about that.

The idea is that we can integrate the pkm syncing with some local model that is run by [olama](https://ollama.com) or [ramalama](https://ramalama.ai). If we can run a smaller model
along with a RAG then we can process synced content (i.e. email threads) to provide more than just a collection of emails, but we can instead summarize the emails. We can determine if emails
are important or if they are just meaningless updates (i.e. a commit has been pushed to a repository, someone says "thanks" in reply, or similar).

Carefully consider this proposal. If it makes sense, look at the code base to see if it is consistent with the intent enough so that we should implement something within it. If it
does make sense, then we would not want to integrate everything directly into this program but we would want to require additional dependencies. The use of ramalama is more appealing
to me due to its containerized nature and integration with podman desktop.
